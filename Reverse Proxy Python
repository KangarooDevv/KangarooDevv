Reverse Proxy Python Script Using IPTables.
Don't let people get IPS that run your services!
now you're asking why python?
well i love .py honestly, but also,
you can easily set a sleep, or a timeout, and then
make this script run everytime for the amount of time you set
if you would like to add it, here is the code!
os.system('timeout 1200 python proxy.py')
so after every 20 minutes it will re proxy itself again :) enjoy!
HOW TO RUN:
python proxy.py
python3 proxy.py
