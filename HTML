these scripts are made so when someone goes to your domain and a certain directory they dont find anything, or you simply want to run a webserver with a nice ui :)
some CSS, BootStrap, Javascript, PHP, and more. Just a few basic .html scripts, and maybe even a front end if im feeling nice ;)
how to run these, install APACHE2
configure apache. 
Place this in /var/www/html directory.
restart apache service, done :) enjoy!!
Index.html and 503.html are using circle image while centering it, and it spins in a infinite loop,
then re directs to fbi.gov for shits and giggles. lolz.
you can edit the url, the picture is in the same directory as index.html (var/www/html)
whatever picture you want to use, just rename it to default.png
and put it in the same directory as index.html/503.html (var/www/html)
done! enjoy :)
i might release a front end site ;) stay tuned!
