Hello, Most of this code will be written by myself, 
i am learning, perl, ruby, bash, batch, golang, python, C, C#, javascript, typescript, php, html, css.
Some of these languages i am very fluent in.
that being said thank you for stopping by :)
most of my code will have tutorials as well (some may not) 
i am also kind of studying RCE, i find it pretty interesting.
i also mess around with pentesting here and there because i sell
some VPN servers :)
